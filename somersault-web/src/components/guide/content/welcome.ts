Welcome to Somersault!

Somersault is a project transforming Sanny Builder scripting language. Built on top of amazing CLEO 5 library it brings many new features and improvements*. 

In the essence, Somersault is a tool that converts (transpiles) the code written in the new language to the format understood by the Sanny Builder compiler. It allows you to write more readable and maintainable code while using a familiar editor.

What you see here is the interactive introduction to the language and its features. You can navigate through the pages using the Next/Back buttons at the top.

This area can be modified. The right panel displays the results as you type. The results are split between two tabs: the transpiled code for the use with Sanny Builder 4 and the compiled bytecode to run as a CLEO 5 script. You can download them using the button in the top right corner.
